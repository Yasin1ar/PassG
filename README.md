## A program for generating random solid 16-digits passwords and saving it in a file in the specific path

### some of the cool features of PassG :
* It's has a simple friendly command-line interface 
* You can access and modify your saved passwords very easily
* it's secure, because it's only a source script and you have access to it, so nothing is hide from your eyes 
* I tried code it based on OOP principles and paradigm, so it's easy to read and manipulate, you can add your own features on it 


### It's clear that it can be more optimize and structured, and have room for more options and features as it keep it's 
### simplicity which is the key characteristic for this program, so I would very appreciate if you optimize, find bugs, upgrade, add features to this program or  help and contribute in any form, thank you.
