# PassG : Password Generator
## A program for generating random solid 8-digits passwords and saving it in a file in the specific path, so it's also a password manager too!
but simpler & faster :)

### some of the cool featurs of PassG :
* It's has a friendly command-line interface 
* You can access and modify your saved passwords
* it's secure
* I coded based on OOP principles and paradigm, so it's easy to read and manipulate, you can add your own features on it :)
